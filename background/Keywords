Learning
Deep:
Machine: Machine learning refers to any computational algorithm that performs a specific task without explicit 
instruction. Such an algorithm relies on pattern recognition and inference in order to complete the task and
learns by experience (taking in many repeated examples of the data to be identified, classified, etc). In this
way, machine learning attempts to mimic the way that humans learn. As a child, you learn that a spoon is called
a "spoon" because a parent repeatedly refers to it as such. Children may misclassify their experiences because 
they have few reference points from which to assess them. Adults are typically more skilled at processing and 
classifying their experiences because they have a foundation of pattern recognition on which to base their 
analysis. Machine learning is an important technique among tasks for which explicit instructions are impossible
to provide (i.e. "tell me which of these objects humans have never seen before").
