### Questions:
- Does each software system have a single API? How would / do multiple APIs work together?
-- "How a user *interacts* with a program" -> They make things as easy for the user as 
possible. You want it to be consistent.
-- Keyword: interface
- What does it mean for an API to be "high-level" vs. "low-level"? What kind of 
hierarchical system are we working in?
-- Low-level: High degree of customization (have to do a lot yourself)...
-- High-level: Gives you ready-made things at the loss of customization...
-- Depends on what degree of customization you *need*
- What does it mean to write code "imperatively"? How is numpy imperative?
- What does it mean for a model to be "fully-packaged"?
- Does the Estimators API provide models that users don't need to train because they 
are already trained, or does it just provide a way to scale the process of training a 
model?
-- Gives you a neural network architecture that you can go ahead and train.

-- Branch of mathematics called "graph theory" (connections, like graphing skin)
-- NNs are graph models + you can use graph theory to help you train it


Architecture:
- API: Defines the architecture by which a user interacts with a software package (e.g. "...subroutine definitions, communication protocols, and tools...").

foundational vocabulary for a piece of software (e.g. "...subroutine 
definitions, communication protocols, and tools..."). If programming is just a bunch of 
instructions for where to point, then the API is the foundational place where all other 
functions, modules (etc.) point.


TensorFlow APIs
- Keras: Builds and trains deep learning models.
- Eager Execution: Allows you to write TensorFlow code imperatively.
- Importing Data: Self-explanatory, pipeline that prepares your input data for the 
TensorFlow ecosystem.
- Estimators: Provides models for large-scale training and production. 


Miscellaneous / Not Yet Sorted Above
- Imperative Programming: "...focuses on describing *how* a program operates."
- Declarative Programming: "...focuses on what the program should accomplish without 
specifying how the program should achieve the result."
