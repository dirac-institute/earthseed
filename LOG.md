# Research Log

Literally just copying and pasting previous entries for "progress" within the README.

March 23, 2020:
- **I have** isolated one class from the training set, all within a Jupyter notebook
- **I have yet to** save the new testing set within the data directory
- **I have yet to** augment the new testing set with `avocado`

- **I encountered** issues with pushing to Github from Epyc
