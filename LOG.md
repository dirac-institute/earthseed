# Research Log

### Literally just copying and pasting previous entries for "progress" within the README.

March 23, 2020:
- **I have** isolated one class from the training set, all within a Jupyter notebook
- **I have yet to** save the new testing set within the data directory
- **I have yet to** augment the new testing set with `avocado`
- **I encountered** issues with pushing to Github from Epyc

March 24, 2020:
- **I have** fixed the issues with pushing to Github from Epyc - yay!
- **I have yet to** sync up my Github and Epyc directory structure. I want to do this so that all the work that I do / progress that I make goes straight to Github.
