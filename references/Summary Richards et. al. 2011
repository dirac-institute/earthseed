Summary
The authors review and perform a standard supervised classification workflow of feature selection, 
tree-based classification, and cross-validation. They classify a set of ~1500 well-known variable 
stars using observations from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) and Hipparcus.

Relevance
This paper offers a thorough introduction to feature selection, tree-based classification methods, 
cross-validation, etc. I may want to return to this paper again for conceptual review when
necessary.

Notable lesson on the value of observation + theory, "For example, the periodic dimming of a light 
curve may be captured with a small number of observable parameters but the inference that that 
source is an eclipsing one requires a theoretical framework."
