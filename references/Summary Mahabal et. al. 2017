Summary
The authors approach the question of object classification by first translating astronomical light 
curves into "dmdt" images and subsequently performing imaging classification on these two-
dimensional representations via a convolutional neural network (CNN). The dmdt images record 
changes in magnitude (dm) and change in time (dt) information between all pairs of points in a 
particular light curve. These dmdt values are then arranged within a two-dimensional image to
create a kaleidoscopic picture. The CNN learns the features of these images, and then learns to 
classify astronomical objects based on image features. They also explore "background subtraction"
for these images, considering both class-specific background subtraction and a general random noise
background subtraction. They discuss the effectiveness of transfer learning of their CNN from one 
astronomical survey to another and conclude that while the CNN did not perform well when transferred 
to a new dataset, it was still an appropriate starting point for classifying the new survey.

Relevance
I'm generally interested in the dmdt image classification method, although I suspect that it 
relies too heavily on survey parameters (such as observational cadence, dt) for its notable 
features (rather than physical properties of the astronomical objects). I really like the idea of 
representing light curves as an image and working with image classification. In particular, the
topic of "background" subtraction of these kaleidoscopic image struck me as an entirely new concern.

A note from the authors, "The standard features do not carry special powers for classifying a varied 
set of objects. The designer features are better for specific classes, but carry with them a bias 
that does not necessarily translate to the classification of a wider set."
