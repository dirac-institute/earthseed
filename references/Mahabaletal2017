Summary: 

Relevance: 

- "The  standard  features  do  not  carry special  powers  for  classifying  a  varied  
set  of  objects.  The designer  features  are  better  for  specific  classes,  but  carry with  
them  a  bias  that  does  not  necessarily  translate  to  the classification of a wider set."
