Every time we observe the Universe in a new way, we discover new phenomena. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory - previously referred to as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) - promises to observe the largest area of the sky, more frequently than any other telescope in astronomical history, with sensitive optical instrumentation. With more observations than humans could ever identify by eye in a lifetime, automatic classification becomes a vital element in navigating the next generation of astronomical research. My objective is to develop a flexible anomaly detection algorithm for heterogeneous time series data (e.g. sparse, irregular, heteroscedastic), beginning with a simulated data set developed for the [Kaggle Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/PLAsTiCC-2018) (PLAsTiCC).
