Exploring unsupervised lightcurve classification on ZTF and subsequently LSST observations.

Giles & Walkowicz 2018: The authors explore unsupervised classification of Kepler objects using the Density-Based Spatial 
Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. They considered Tabby's Star as a proof-of-concept case from which they could determine the effectiveness of their classifier.
